GitKraken 101:

When starting a new change:
	Create a new branch (this is only on your local machine at first)
		- name it the change you are going to be working on.
	
	Do your work (edit/create/delete files)

	At the end of every work session stage then commit all changes to branch.
	Then push to online repo so it is backed up!!

	Once done with that given task, stage, commit then push to online branch.
	Then create a merge request to merge your branch with the master branch.
		- Only do this if you know that your branch  won't break the master!

	once branch is merged, start on next task by creating a new branch.

	Repeat till project is done!
